    <h1>About Thanksgiving</h1>
    <p>During the celebration, Massasoit, an important sachem (leader) of the Wampanoag People, along with 90 of his men, joined the English for three days of entertainment and feasting. We don­’t know for sure why the Wampanoag joined the gathering or exactly what activities went on during those three days. We do know, however, that the celebration occurred sometime between September 21 and November 9, 1621. Later, in the 19th century, the event entered American popular imagination as the First Thanksgiving.</p>

  <center> <h3>The Turkey Song</h3>
A turkey sat on a backyard fence and he sang this sad, sad tune: 
    <br>
"Thanksgiving Day is coming gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble 
And I know I'll be eaten soon!  
    <br>
Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, 
    <br>
I would like to run away-- 
    <br>
Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, 
    <br>
I don't like Thanksgiving Day!"
